## Getting Started

In this project, as this is the backend of the application of 'Housify', one can explore the backend while running the application locally by following steps as mentioned below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - NodeJS, A Java Script runtime.

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

Here are steps to follow to get a development environment running.
(At this point, we assume that 'Node' as mentioned above in installed in local environment)

Note: There are some libraries which were used to create this backend are: express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, body-parser, cors

Step 1: To verify if Node is installed on the system, open a command prompt (if windows), and write `node` to the terminal, verify that system will respond with valid node version.

i.e.,

```
Welcome to Node.js v16.13.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
```
Step 2: Open the cloned directory in VSCode, then `cd back-end` to move into the backend project

Step 3: It is a time to install all the dependencies which are necessary to run, to do that, run following command in the cmd: `npm install` / `npm i`

Step 4: We have all the dependencies installed, we can run the application, for that run the following command in the cmd: `npm start`

This way, the backend project is up and running on the local host and you can interact with the application now either through running front end or using the tool such as [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/)
