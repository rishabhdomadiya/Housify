## Getting Started

In this project, as it the frontend of the application 'Housify', one can examin the application while running the application locally by following steps as mentioned below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - NodeJS, A Java Script runtime (for react frontend)

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

Here are steps to follow to get a development environment running.
(At this point, we assume that 'Node' as mentioned above in installed in local environment)

Note: There are some libraries which were used to create a react app are: axios, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap

Step 1: To verify if Node is installed on the system, open a command prompt (if windows), and write `node` to the terminal, verify that system will respond with valid node version.

i.e.,

```
Welcome to Node.js v16.13.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
```
Step 2: To move into the frontend directory, `cd front-end`

Step 3: It is a time to install all the dependencies which are necessary to run the frontend of the project, to do that, run following command in the cmd: `npm install` / `npm i`

Step 4: We have all the dependencies installed, we can run the application, for that run the following command in the cmd: `npm start`

This way, the frontend project is up and running on the local host, displaying the Login Form on home screen, you can interact with the application now (Assuming that backend is running).

There will be A Sign-in Page as initial screen, one can visit the registration page from sign-in page (assuming that back-end is running, as user authentication is linked with backend)
